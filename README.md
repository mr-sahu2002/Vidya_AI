## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.x and pip
- Firebase account `.json` file with authentication & database access
- GCP service account

---

## Core Setup & Example Commands

### Qdrant (Vector Database)

```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
-v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
qdrant/qdrant
```

- REST API: `http://localhost:6333`  
- GRPC API: `http://localhost:6334`  
- Data is stored on your machine in `./qdrant_storage`.

---

### Node.js Application

```bash
npm i         # Install dependencies
npm start     # Start the Node.js server
```

---

### Python API (using Uvicorn)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

---

## Firebase Authentication

1. Obtain your **Firebase service account `.json` authentication file**.
2. Place this file securely in your backend directory.
3. Ensure your Firebase project has both authentication and Firestore access enabled.

  Creates materials tailored to your specific community, classroom, or school‚Äîensuring relevance for local needs.

- **Instant Student Q&A Simplifier**  
  Uses AI to rephrase or answer student questions at an age-appropriate level.

- **White Board Animation**  
  Transforms concepts into animated video explainers (e.g., using Imagen or similar models).

- **Persona Profiling (with Firestore)**  
  Interactively builds individual student profiles through targeted questions, storing data in Firestore for adaptive learning.

- **On-the-Fly Educational Game Generator**  
  Combines persona and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to create personalized educational game experiences that boost subject understanding by using llm js output to generate educational concept simulator.

- **AI-Powered Weekly Lesson Planner**  
  Automatically constructs optimized lesson plans based on curriculum, class performance, and student needs.

- **AI-Driven Recommendations**  
  Suggests resources and next steps based on analytics from student profiles and classroom progress.

## Project Structure

```
/qdrant_storage         # Local persistent storage for Qdrant
/frontend               # Node.js (likely React/Next.js)
/backend                # Python FastAPI server (main:app)
firebase_config.json    # Firebase service account (keep secret!)
```

- Firestore (Firebase) integration for persona and authentication  
- Docker for virtualization and data management

## Running the Full Stack: Example Sequence

```bash
# 1. Start Qdrant for vector search
docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 \
-v $(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z \
qdrant/qdrant

# 2. Install backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run Python backend
uvicorn main:app --reload

# 4. Install frontend dependencies
npm i

# 5. Start frontend
npm start

# 6. Place your Firebase service account .json file in the backend
```

## Important Notes

- üîí **Keep your Firebase authentication files secure**‚Äîdo not commit them to source control.
- üîÅ Change all default passwords and ports before production use.
- üíæ Make sure data directories are persisted with Docker volumes.
- üìñ For more details, consult `/docs` or configuration files in the repo.

Thank you!
